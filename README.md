# Project Title

Rest API with NodeJs, React, Web3Js, Ethereum Smart Contract and MongoDB

## Getting Started

Node Resp should run the program.

A smart contract is deployed at Rinkeby network, you can check the transactions:
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xff59756e5a7a3ce03b6658bab03a3a11c564abfd

Use the private key to test:
0x123ce564d427a3319b6536bbcef1390d69395b06es6c481954e971d960fe8907

The CRUD is executed in the Ethereum Block Chain, the mongoDB is here for record all the transactions and data input.
